# GIS Integration and Capabilities

GIS (Geographic Information Systems) integrates various data types and provides comprehensive tools for spatial analysis.

## GIS Connects Your Data

With GIS, you can integrate and analyze a wide range of data, including:
- **Reports**: Combine spatial data with textual reports to provide context.
- **Charts**: Visualize data trends and patterns on maps.
- **Photos**: Geotag and analyze locations with photographic evidence.
- **Presentations**: Enhance presentations with spatial data visualization.
- **Timelines**: Correlate spatial data with temporal changes.
- **Sales Data**: Map sales data to identify geographic trends.
- **Customer Data**: Analyze customer distribution and demographics.
- **Staff Data**: Manage and visualize staff locations and movements.

## GIS Datasets

GIS datasets consist of:
- **Points, Lines, Polygons**: Represent different types of spatial features.
- **Real World Locations**: Map and analyze geographic positions.
- **Feature Class Data**: Store and manage collections of related features.

## GIS Layers

GIS layers are visual representations of spatial data. They can display:
- **Feature Class Symbols**: Icons or shapes representing features.
- **Feature Class Colors**: Color coding for different types of features.
- **Feature Class Filters**: Selective display based on specific criteria.

Within an organization, different teams may choose different layers to display based on their specific needs. When a GIS dataset is updated in a feature class, the corresponding GIS layer updates automatically throughout the system.

### Example: Land Records of Linn County

By using GIS layers, teams can efficiently manage and access updated land records and related spatial data.

## Remote Sensing

Remote sensing is the science of obtaining information about objects or areas from a distance, typically from aircraft or satellites. Key aspects include:
- **Pixel Spectral Reflectance**: Each pixel in a raster dataset records the amount of light reflected from the Earth.
- **Infrared Imaging**: Allows documentation and analysis of critical agricultural data.

### Applications of Remote Sensing

- **Predicting Land Types**: Differentiate between water and land.
- **Analyzing Crop Situations**: Assess the health and status of crops.
- **Finding Spectral Matches**: Use GIS to match pixels' spectral reflectance for various analyses.

## LiDAR: Creating 3D Models

LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) technology enables the creation of detailed 3D models. Key points include:
- **How It Works**: LiDAR uses laser pulses to measure distances to the Earth's surface.
- **GIS + LiDAR**: Integrating GIS with LiDAR data allows for the creation of accurate 3D models.
- **3DEP**: The 3D Elevation Program (3DEP) supports the collection of high-quality elevation data.

By leveraging LiDAR and remote sensing technologies, GIS can provide detailed and accurate spatial analysis for various applications.

## Asking Map Questions

- **GIS lets you pick through huge stacks of data to answer complex questions.**

  Geographic Information Systems (GIS) enable users to sift through vast amounts of spatial data to find insights and solutions to complex geographical problems. By integrating various layers of data, GIS allows for spatial analysis that helps in understanding relationships, patterns, and trends in geographic information.

- **Uses SQL**

  SQL (Structured Query Language) is commonly used in GIS to query and manage spatial data stored in databases. It allows GIS analysts and users to retrieve specific data subsets, perform spatial operations, and generate meaningful insights from spatial datasets stored in relational databases.

## Analysis with Imagery and Surfaces

- **Using point measures**

  GIS software and applications provide tools for analyzing point data, such as GPS coordinates or specific locations. This capability is crucial for various applications, including asset management, environmental monitoring, and urban planning, where precise location-based measurements are required.

- **GIS Software and apps have tools with science built-in**

  Modern GIS software and applications incorporate scientific algorithms and analytical tools that facilitate advanced spatial analysis. These tools are designed to handle complex calculations, spatial modeling, and visualization, making it easier for users to interpret and derive meaningful conclusions from geographic data.

- **Construction designers can use elevation data for line-of-sight studies.**

  Elevation data derived from GIS allows construction designers and planners to perform line-of-sight studies, which are critical for designing infrastructure, ensuring visibility for safety and regulatory compliance.

- **Hydrologists can use elevation data to predict where water will gather.**

  Elevation data in GIS is instrumental for hydrologists in predicting the flow of water across landscapes. It helps identify watershed boundaries, determine flow direction, and anticipate areas prone to flooding or water accumulation, aiding in effective water resource management.

- **Transportation engineers can use elevation data to determine the size of a drain.**

  GIS-based elevation data assists transportation engineers in assessing terrain characteristics and gradients, essential for designing drainage systems and ensuring efficient water runoff management in transportation infrastructure projects.

- **GIS can be used to calculate the percentage of water-resistant surfaces.**

  GIS enables the calculation and analysis of water-resistant surfaces within a geographic area. This capability supports urban planning efforts by identifying impervious surfaces like pavement and rooftops, which affect stormwater runoff patterns and urban heat island effects.

- **Raster data is easy to analyze and freely available.**

  Raster data, which consists of gridded cells representing geographic features and attributes, is widely used in GIS for spatial analysis. It is easy to analyze using GIS software tools and is often available freely from government agencies and organizations, making it accessible for various research and planning applications.
